# What is Mixed Signal SoC design Marathon using eSim & SKY130?

The purpose of the Mixed Signal SoC design Marathon using eSim & SKY130 is to provide an open platform for students to innovate, create state-of-the-art design and integrate it into real-world applications. This marathon is based on eSim, an open-source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, and PCB design, developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. eSim is an open-source alternative to PSpice, OrCAD, etc. 

FOSSEE, IIT Bombay, along with Google and VLSI System Design Corp. Pvt. Ltd is organizing this online Mixed Signal SoC design Marathon using eSim & SKY130.
 
# Problem Statement of the Hackathon
 The participants are expected to design Mixed Signal Circuits using the eSim Software with SKY130 PDK and NgVeri, simulate and analyze their circuits.
